# fast-hashring

fast-hashring is a lightweight JavaScript library offering an efficient implementation of consistent hashing using virtual nodes. Designed for high performance, it provides fast and scalable key distribution, ideal for load balancing, caching, and data sharding in distributed systems.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install fast-hashring
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add fast-hashring
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to integrate fast-hashring into your project:

```js
import ConsistentHash from 'fast-hashring'

const ch = new ConsistentHash({ virtualNodes: 100 })
ch.addNode('server1')
ch.addNode('server2')

const node = ch.getNode('my-key')
console.log(`Key is assigned to node: ${node}`)
```

## Features

- **Consistent Hashing with Virtual Nodes:**  
  Utilizes virtual nodes to distribute keys evenly across real nodes, minimizing load imbalance during node changes.

- **Binary Search for Rapid Lookups:**  
  Maintains a sorted hash ring of virtual nodes, enabling quick key lookups using an optimized binary search algorithm.

- **High Performance & Scalability:**  
  The design focuses on speed and efficiency, ensuring low latency and high throughput even with large-scale deployments.

- **Simple & Intuitive API:**  
  Easy-to-use methods for adding, removing, and retrieving nodes enable quick integration into projects.

- **TypeScript Support:**  
  Complete TypeScript definitions are provided, offering strong typing and an improved developer experience.

## Why Choose fast-hashring?

fast-hashring delivers superior performance by leveraging virtual nodes and binary search, providing a more balanced and efficient key distribution compared to traditional hashing methods. Whether you're scaling a distributed cache, load balancer, or sharded database, fast-hashring minimizes remapping and disruption, ensuring high availability and smooth performance.
